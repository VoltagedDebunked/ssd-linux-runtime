# SSD-Linux-Runtime

## Overview

**SSD-Linux-Runtime** is a runtime library and daemon for optimizing file I/O and system calls for SSD-based storage. It leverages the unique characteristics of SSDs to enhance performance, reduce write amplification, and extend lifespan.

## Features

- **Direct I/O Optimization**: Implements custom functions for efficient reading and writing using direct I/O, bypassing the page cache.
- **Wear Leveling Awareness**: Minimizes unnecessary writes to maximize SSD lifespan.
- **TRIM Command Management**: Automates TRIM operations to notify SSDs about unused data blocks.
- **SSD Health Monitoring**: Tracks SSD health using S.M.A.R.T. technology to warn about potential failures.
- **Daemonized Operation**: Runs as a background service to continuously optimize and monitor SSD performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voltageddebunked/ssd-linux-runtime.git
   cd ssd-linux-runtime
   ```

2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Install the daemon:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

## Usage

Run the daemon:
```bash
sudo ssd-linux-runtime
```

## Configuration

Configuration options can be added in the future to customize settings such as the frequency of health checks and the specific SSD device to monitor.
